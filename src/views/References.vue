                                We worked with Stephan on a project since 2018 to 2019 as a peer developer. He is excellent engineer that knows his profession and is competent to deal with superiors. His main competences are knowledge of Internet technologies, Python 2/3 and its components and agile software development. Steve is also friendly colleague that is able to discuss issues and to learn new technologies. Foremost, he is performance oriented.
                                I very regret that the project was discontinued and we could not work jointly together.

                                  It is rare that you come across standout talent like Steve. I had the pleasure of working with Steve for 2 years, collaborating on several project teams, like Mobile App Development or Building Continuous Delivery Pipelines. Steve's ability to juggle multiple complex software projects, be it latest Cloud Infrastructure or CI/CD Technologies was amazing and made a great difference in the productivity level of our team.
                                  Oh, and he made sure our work desks were never without Whiteboard Markers, screen adapters or even mechanical keyboards, Very motivating.

                                I had the great pleasure to work with Stephan Kristyn for almost 3 years. We were working on a mobile application infrastructure for one of our clients. Stephan often took the initiative to push the project in difficult situations. With high motivation he introduced Kubernetes to our team and migrated the build pipelines. He set up and integrated automated testing and test reporting frameworks. He also showed deep understanding in our efforts to build, deploy and publish our Ionic based App to the stores. As an evangelist of the scrum methodology he helped us to stream line the process. His overall skills span a wide range of technologies from the entire DevOp stack. He was always eager to learn new stuff and never shyed away from getting his hands dirty.

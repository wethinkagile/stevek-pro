                                        I’m lucky to know enough about Networks and the Web now, to call myself a Site Reliability Engineer. 
                                        This encompasses <b>Full Stack Web Development</b> and on the other side SRE means you have the responsibily of making production the best it possibly can be.

                                        I became motivated to step up from being a SE to being a SRE after leading a small Ops team of 3 in my last project,

                                        slow, repetitive and manual processes in a Software Delivery Pipeline, Software Engineers tend to automate these processes, because building automatons that abstract difficulty away from the human is what we Software Engineers do.
